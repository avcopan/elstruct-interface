- get the symmetry for the vibrational frequencies
- all files, specify units of values (either comment in line in geom xyz, or top of file)
- store Hessian in as full Hessian or triangle (upper or lower)
- see what code in unittools, obtools, and iotools are needed to be redone
- Energy level of theory and basis set and units at top
